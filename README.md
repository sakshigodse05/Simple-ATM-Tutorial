# 🏧 Simple ATM Simulation in Python

This project is a simple **ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation** built using Python.  
It demonstrates core programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, functions, input handling, and basic user authentication.

---

## 📌 Features
The ATM simulation supports the following operations:

- **User Authentication (PIN verification)**  
- **Check Account Balance**  
- **Withdraw Cash**  
- **Deposit Cash**  
- **Change ATM PIN**  
- **Exit/Logout**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Basic I/O operations  
- Control flow (if-else, loops)  
- Time module for delays

---

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
python simpleatm.py


🧠 Program Flow

User enters PIN

Selects operation from menu

System performs requested action

User can continue or exit

ATM returns updated balance after each operation

🎯 Purpose of This Project
